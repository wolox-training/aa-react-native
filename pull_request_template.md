## Summary
A brief description of the pull request.

## Known issues / Notes (Optional)
If you found any issues while developing the feature, this is the place where you should detail everything.
Also you can report bugs found or any missing functionality.

## Screenshots or GIFs
If your code modifies front end views, then you should attach screenshots for every modification.
You should add a screenshot of the original design and your implementation, for various devices or browsers.

If you need to record a video (or gif) to show a change in flow or animations:
- you can use [LICECap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for OSX
- you can check [this](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CreatingScreencasts) for Ubuntu to add animated gifs to your pull request to show some transitions between views
- you can use QuickTime to record from device (if you need to test on device because of bluetooth use for example). Check [this](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/record-iphone-screen-quicktime/) tutorial on how to record a screencast with Quicktime and then check [this](https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207) tutorial on how to convert the `.mov` to `.gif` file in order to be able to attach it to the pull request.

## Trello Card
You could add any other section you may need, like _Discussion_ for example.
